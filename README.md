# EduConnect-Website-Model

This project is the basic architectual structure of the dynamic website EduConnect, which is a dynamic website for STEM cooperation between high school students. The code for the actual website isn't shown for privacy protection purposes, but essentially, it is built based on the code structure of this project. It is based on a Flaskr dynamic website module.

The website is structured as a blog post website, which in the context of EduConnect consists of content related to college application for STEM students. Apart from the basic functions of a dynamic website, such as requiring an account number and password to make and reply to posts, the website also consists of a page-flip function, in which a page only consists of 10 posts to save computational space for running the website. It also has a view count mechanism for each post, a customizer for personal information, a link to the description of the website, a link to a search bar for searching for posts with the exact keywords, and an inserted OpenAI API.

Before logging in with an user account, the website displays the posts, the authors, and the content and replies if clicked into the post. After logging in, users will get access to posting posts and replies, the personal information customizer, the website description, the search bar, the OpenAI interface.

The actual EduConnect website has over 200 users.
